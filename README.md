## My Learning outcomes

- Grid: first time I was using CSS Grid for the layout and I love how powerful it is!
- Practiced more CSS from the very basics.
- Practiced to fully complete the home project.
- In general I feel that these exercises helped me to fill some gaps in my CSS knowledge but I haven't found these exercises challenging enough.
